                        43 reviews","My name is Todd Van Linda, and I am a freelance Concept Artist and illustrator from West Palm Beach, Florida. While I have been drawing with pencil and pen and ink since I was a child, I have been working freelance full - time as an artist / illustrator since January of 2010.

My previous work has been quite the mix; I'm not sure that there's anything I haven't illustrated at one time or another, in one style or another. While I am a big adherent to traditional pencil and pen and ink techniques, I am also a daily Photoshop user for the digital aspects. Digital painting is a major focus.


A REQUEST FOR QUOTE NEEDS TO INCLUDE:
1. WHAT you want
2. HOW MANY you want
3. WHAT style, type, other applicable details you want
4. WHAT it should look like when done
5. WHEN you want it / them.
6. And anything else you feel is important.

I am neither the cheapest nor the fastest, and I never will be either of those things. If that's what you're after, best move on. 

     If, on the other hand, you want a highly skilled illustrator that takes your project, characters and story seriously, one who takes the time to read and delve into the details to truly represent your story and what goes into it, then you're in the right place.

The contest was twelve years ago. Since then, I am still writing. 

What am I writing?
Anything. 

I enjoy writing articles based on subjects from the sociological, psychological, ideological, and economic fields, or anything exciting. Also, I am interested in metaphysics, sociology, marketing, blogging, designing, video editing, publishing, ghostwriting, history, coloring, gaming, fishing, baking, traveling, and keeping up-to-date with technological innovations. During my Masters at the University of Greenwich, I successfully validated my hypothesis in my research and advanced the understanding of identity on social media. 

From my focus on media, researching behaviors, and societal issues in general to academic research, market research, reviews, scripts, and website content, I am interested in expanding my knowledge and consistently exploring new areas.  less"

Trading requires experience, and there are two ways to gain it. The first is by trading, but this can be costly and often involves losses. The second way is by using Pine Script to develop indicators and strategies that analyze past price movements. By doing so, traders can gain valuable experience and insights into the markets without risking their capital. Pine Script allows traders to test their ideas and strategies on historical data, analyze the results, and refine their approaches accordingly. This approach not only helps traders gain experience but also enables them to develop more effective trading strategies. Pine Script plays a crucial role in helping traders gain the experience they need to succeed in the markets while minimizing their risk.

As an experienced Pine Script developer, I specialize in creating custom indicators, strategies, and scripts for the TradingView platform. With 4 years of experience, I have honed my expertise in Pine Script's syntax, data manipulation, and charting capabilities to deliver high-quality code that meets my clients' specific needs.

I am dedicated to providing excellent customer service and pride myself on my attention to detail and communication skills. Throughout the development process, I will keep you updated on my progress and am open to feedback and suggestions to ensure that the final product meets your expectations.

I also place great importance on the style and quality of my Pine Script projects. By using clear and concise code, effective charting, and attention to detail, I aim to create Pine Script solutions that are not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to use.

I offer a range of services. Whether you need a simple script or a complex algorithm, I can tailor my solutions to your requirements and deliver them on time and within budget: 
- Creating Custom Indicators
- Debugging Pine Script Code
- Combining Existing Indicators
- Updating Existing Indicators
- Generating Trading Signals
- Creating Custom Alerts
- Building Custom Screeners
- Plotting Custom Visualization
- Developing Backtesting Systems
- Implementing Risk Management
- Creating Trading Systems

I strive to provide my clients with custom Pine Script solutions that are both effective and visually appealing, while also helping them gain the experience they need to succeed in the markets.

NOTE
* I assure you that I don't sell or share any of the code I wrote before. To proceed with your project, kindly provide me with the project details. Your satisfaction and the uniqueness of the solution are my top priorities.

With more than 15 years experience in different programming languages, It is my job to stay on top of the ever changing internet environment and provide my clients with a quality Web & Mobile presence that would be impossible for them to achieve alone.

Small to mid-size businesses often don't have the time to keep on top of the ever changing Web world, as they often need to dedicate their time and effort into maintaining their core business. At the same time, they also do not have the resources that a large company has to fund an internet technology department and hire expensive IT workers to keep on top of their web presence. This is where I come in, I provide an affordable solution for these small to mid-size businesses.

Please contact me directly for further inquiries, as I am available even during the weekends.

In addition, I had the privilege of working for a furniture company, where I designed furniture and stands for prestigious perfume brands such as GIORGIO ARMANI, YSL, LANCOME, CHANEL and HUGO BOSS.

I am currently working as an independent Designer, helping companies and clients to achieve their goals. I can work from a ''simple idea'' or ''concept'', and through a design process, and in turn, using professional 3D modeling and rendering tools, I can transform that ''idea'' or '' concept'' into an actual product that can be manufactured and used.

Are you planning to make a cool software or make a cool video game? Or perhaps seeking to test the waters with a quick prototype? 

How about adding new functionality to your existing project? Or need ideas on how to make money in the video game business with your community? 

Whether you need help planning, producing your video game, or just thinking up cool ideas, I'm here for you!

I'll help you make your game engaging and keep players wanting more!✨

I've been consuming and making video games for about 2 decades, and I can help you make your dream game come true. We'll use nice tools and tricks to make awesome games right at home which dramatically lower production costs. 

We'll set goals to make sure everything goes smoothly. Making a video game is like cooking a yummy meal, you need the right ingredients (assets) and time to prepare. 

My AI-powered method makes sure we use the best things for each project.

Game design documents (GDD) are essential for efficient execution and cost-saving. Depending on the project I might start by asking about your game design document, as it's the pillar for success on many projects. If you don't have one, I can help you create one - initial costs may vary depending on the length of your game, but pricing starts at $1990.

A GDD helps you have clarity on execution, avoid costly mistakes, help you save money, and.... time.

We offer comprehensive services to help bring your videogame to life, including:

✅ Videogame Consulting
✅ Statistics & Analytics
✅ Project Planning & Design
✅ Concept Art & Illustration
✅ Networking & Infrastructure
✅ 2D/3D Graphics & Visual Effects
✅ Augmented, Virtual & Mixed Reality
✅ Music Composition & Sound Effects
✅ Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
✅ Blockchain Integration & Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
✅ ChatGPT, OpenAI Model Fine-tunning, OpenAI API & Stable Diffusion API

My hourly rate applies to private consulting only.

 - Every project is different, and so is the time and investment required.

For project development, I usually go by milestones.

Your satisfaction is guaranteed!

If for any reason the final product does not align with the agreed upon milestones or quality standards, we commit to making it right. Whether it's additional polishing, further development cycles, or necessary adjustments, we continue refining until your vision is perfectly realized. less"
